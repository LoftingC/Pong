# Pong
This is a simple pong game coded in Python using the turtle library.

First a screen is created for teh program to run on and edited using different methods to imitate the original pong terminal with a score board.

Secondly, the ball and paddles are created using a turtle class and editing methods such as shapesize, speed and goto for positioning.

Then the functions are coded to allow for movement of the paddles vertically. 

Finally the main game loop coded is written which will run serveral if statements to serve as border checking as well as paddle collision detection and point allocation.
To finish this project i added a sound file which will play whenever the ball bounces off an object such as a paddle or either of the top and bottom borders.
